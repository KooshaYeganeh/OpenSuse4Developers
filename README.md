## Zsh and oh-my-zsh 


```
sudo zypper -n install zsh
```

```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

For the image to have zsh from the moment you start, add a line to the settings of the bashrc file

```
sudo vi ~/.bashrc
```

add **exec zsh** to end of Line and write and quit.


## Install VsCode
*1- It is true that Vim is the best text editor, but if the number of lines of your code increases and you need to open and edit many files (especially in web applications), vscode will help you.*




``` 
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
```



```
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ntype=rpm-md\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscode.repo'
```


```
sudo zypper refresh
```


```
sudo zypper install code
```




## Install Docker

[Docker](./images/docker.png)

```
sudo zypper install -y docker
```
```
sudo systemctl start docker
```
```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```


## vundle
*These are my personal settings for the Vim editor and are set for programming with Python. In order for you to have your own settings, you must first install vundle and then install your settings and plugins.*

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

```
    set nocompatible              " required
    filetype off                  " required

    " set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
    set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    call vundle#begin()
    "
    " alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
    " call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')
    "
    " let Vundle manage Vundle, required
    Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
    Plugin 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'
    Plugin 'nvie/vim-flake8'
    Plugin 'vim-scripts/indentpython.vim'
    Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
    Plugin 'jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs'
    Plugin 'Lokaltog/powerline', {'rtp': 'powerline/bindings/vim/'}
    Plugin 'chriskempson/base16-vim'
    Plugin 'wuelnerdotexe/vim-enfocado'
    " add all your plugins here (note older versions of Vundle
    " used Bundle instead of Plugin)
    "
    " ...
    "
    " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
    call vundle#end()            " required
    filetype plugin indent on    " required

    set encoding=utf-8

    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.py

## git


```
sudo zypper install git
```

## MariaDB

```sudo rpm --import https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB```
```
sudo zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
```  
```
sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck --refresh https://yum.mariadb.org/10.7/opensuse/15/x86_64 mariadb
```
```
sudo zypper refresh
```  
```
sudo zypper install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client
```

**Note : To add the user and password in MariaDB's config file 
(so that you don't have to enter the user and password every time in your system) you musy do This :**

```
sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
```

We add these lines to the config File:

```
[client]
user=koosha
password=10203
```

## Nginx

[Nginx](https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nginx-Logo.png)


```
sudo zypper -n install nginx
```

**Note : The default path of static files in the Nginix web server is a 
little different from other Linuxes. In most Linuxes, it is in the `/var/www/nginx`
but in OpenSuse it is in the  `/srv/www/htdocs` path.**


## Apache

[Apache](https://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/asf_logo.png)

```
sudo zypper -n install apache2
```


## Multimedia Codec

*After installing OpenSuse, we often see an error (h256 codec) that does not allow us to play videos.
To solve this problem, we can either install VLC or follow the steps below:*

```
sudo zypper addrepo -cfp 90 'https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/' packman
```
```
sudo zypper addrepo -cfp 90 'https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Leap_$releasever/' packman
```
```
sudo zypper refresh
```

```
sudo zypper dist-upgrade --from packman --allow-vendor-change
```

## Install TLP for better power management

```
sudo zypper install tlp tlp-rdw
```
```
sudo systemctl enable tlp
```

## configure /tmp

*In OpenSuse, the contents of the /tmp directory are not deleted by default every boot,
if you want this directory to be deleted, we create a tmp.conf file in the /etc/tmpfiles.d path.*

```
vi /etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf
```
*add this Line*
```
D /tmp 1777 root root -
```
or

*Or in GUI you can chnage setting from the path system_setttng -> privacy -> purge Trash and Temporary Files -> purge After *


## Security

If you are a programmer and you have a suse virtual server for your work
and you want to install Package tcp wrappers on your server, 
in this case Sousse works like Ubuntu and the name of Package tcp wrappers is different from other RPMs.


### ClamAV

[clamAV](https://logodix.com/logo/1583401.png)

```

**Updating virus database signatures**

```
sudo freshclam
```

> Ù”Important Note : If an error occurs while updating the signatures, you can download the database separately and place it in your specified path.

```
wget  https://database.clamav.net/daily.cvd
```

```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/clamav

```

**Updating Maldet**
*First run the following command to create the correct paths for the logged-in user; you may have issues updating without doing this.*

``` 
sudo /usr/local/sbin/maldet --mkpubpaths
```

**To update the Maldet virus definitions database, execute the following command:**
